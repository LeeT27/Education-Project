# Education Project

## 8/27: Project Brainstorming
##### Semester Project: Free Educational Website
###### **Research Question** - How can I make an impact on the educational landscape?
###### **Goal** - Create a non-profit education website teaching a certain curriculem
###### **Approach** - Learn advanced front end coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in order create a neat website
###### **Outcome** - An actual functioning website that has the ability to educate students
###### **Resources required** - A computer and a hardworking mindset
## 8/30-9/1: Project plan
##### Step 1: Research question
###### Is there anything a student can do to influence the educational landscape? For example, according to a 2013 infographic about math education, only 44% of high school graduates in the U.S. were ready for college level math. Another fact stated was that 8 out of the top 10 dominating jobs in the world require math, tech, or science skills. 
##### Step 2: AI implementation
###### I will use AI for my project for two main uses. First, I will implement AI by using it to code html and css much easier through making ideas easier in order to make the website look neat and beautiful. Second, I will implement AI by embedding AI into the website in order to quiz the student on various topics.
##### Step 3: Timeline
###### September - Learn advanced front end coding through a website curriculum, October - Build the website frame and functionality, November - Decorate the website to make it more neat and cool and maybe get started on doing partial back end, December - Finish back-end of the website
##### Step 4: Documentation
###### I intend to update this document daily by adding commits and mark my progress depending on dates or a range of dates
## 9/5-9/8: Learning Front end curriculem:
###### (background: I have already completed the full html and css certificate on freecodecamp, but I need to do everything again to review numerous concepts)
###### I will find a website with a free and popular curriculem to start learning basic html and then eventually going on to advanced html, basic css, and advanced css and then get started on the first few lessons
### 9/8 update:
###### Finish freecodingcamp.org "Learning HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" and "Learn basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu" by Monday 9/11, I am currently 1/3 of the way
## 9/11-9/15: Front end learning 2
### 9/11 update: 
###### Over the weekend and parts of last week, I completed the goals of finishing the two projects listed above. Because I already completed the front-end curriculem once, I feel that it is only neccessary to do the important projects of it, therefore by Wednesday, my goal is to complete "Learn HTML forms by building a registration form" and "Learn accessability by making a quiz
