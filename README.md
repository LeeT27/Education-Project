## 8/27: Project Brainstorming
##### Semester Project: Free Educational Website
###### **Research Question** - How can I make an impact on the educational landscape?
###### **Goal** - Create a non-profit education website teaching a certain curriculem
###### **Approach** - Learn advanced front end coding (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) in order create a neat website
###### **Outcome** - An actual functioning website that has the ability to educate students
###### **Resources required** - A computer and a hardworking mindset
## 8/30-9/1: Project plan
##### Step 1: Research question
###### Is there anything a student can do to influence the educational landscape? For example, according to a 2013 infographic about math education, only 44% of high school graduates in the U.S. were ready for college level math. Another fact stated was that 8 out of the top 10 dominating jobs in the world require math, tech, or science skills. 
##### Step 2: AI implementation
###### I will use AI for my project for two main uses. First, I will implement AI by using it to code html and css much easier through making ideas easier in order to make the website look neat and beautiful. Second, I will implement AI by embedding AI into the website in order to quiz the student on various topics.
##### Step 3: Timeline
###### September - Learn advanced front end coding through a website curriculum, October - Build the website frame and functionality, November - Decorate the website to make it more neat and cool and maybe get started on doing partial back end, December - Finish back-end of the website
##### Step 4: Documentation
###### I intend to update this document daily by adding commits and mark my progress depending on dates or a range of dates
## 9/5-9/8: Learning Front end curriculem:
###### (background: I have already completed the full html and css certificate on freecodecamp, but I need to do everything again to review numerous concepts)
###### I will find a website with a free and popular curriculem to start learning basic html and then eventually going on to advanced html, basic css, and advanced css and then get started on the first few lessons
### 9/8 update:
###### Finish freecodingcamp.org "Learning HTML by Building a Cat Photo App" and "Learn basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu" by Monday 9/11, I am currently 1/3 of the way
## 9/11-9/15: Front end learning 2
### 9/11 update: 
###### Over the weekend and parts of last week, I completed the goals of finishing the two projects listed above. Because I already completed the front-end curriculem once, I feel that it is only neccessary to do the important projects of it, therefore by next week, my goal is to complete "Learn HTML forms by building a registration form" and "Learn accessability by making a quiz
### 9/12 update: Last week error
###### After being told that proof of completion is required for each week, I found that using my old account for freecodecamp.org is much more challenging to show proof of completion, therefore I made a new account where progress could be tracked daily. This would mean that I would have to redo the first two projects, but already knowing how they work, they should not take too much time. Here is the link for the new profile >>> https://www.freecodecamp.org/ethanjlee
## 9/18-9/22: Front end learning 3
###### I was very sick last Friday and over the weekend, therefore I was pretty pressed for time and couldn't get a Friday update in, but still I ended up finishing the two challenges on freecodecamp.com. This week, I intend to spread out my work more and then finish "Learn the CSS box model by building a rothiko painting" and "Learn CSS flexbox by building a photo gallery".
### 9/20 update: 
###### Finished "Learn the CSS box model by building a rothiko painting", which taught about how the CSS box model works, which may be useful for my project in terms of formatting elements with correct spacing
### 9/25 update: 
###### Finished "Learn CSS Flexbox by Building a Photo Gallery"
## 9/26-9/29: Front end learning final
###### Goal for this week: Finish two more lessons and then get started with the project next week!
### 10/1 update: 
###### Finished "Learn Responsive Design By Building a Piano" and "Learn CSS Animation by Building a Ferris Wheel". I am officially done with the front end learning phase and will begin building the website over the course of next month :)
## 10/2-10/6: Project Base
###### This week I will begin to make the skeleton for the education website
### 10/4 update: 
###### Before actually starting the project building, I've been looking through various templete online, not to copy from, but to gain inspiration from. The link to the website is https://colorlib.com/wp/cat/education/. This would support by design for CSS and knowing efficient ways for the user to interact.
### 10/10 update: 
###### Began making project skeleton and plan to finish so by next week
## 10/11-10/13: Project Base 2
### 10/11 update:
###### Progress done on "about me page"
### 10/15 update:
###### Finished skeleton for "library" tab, which will contain the learning content for the website
## 10/11-10/13: Project Base 3
### 10/16 update:
###### Going to start showing updates with pictures and captions. Today, I focused on making the home screen a little more fancy, here is what it looks like.

### 10/22 update:
###### I forgot to update throughtout the week in which I will do more this week, but I will give a huge rundown of what I have completed in the past week. My goal for the past two weeks was to finish the website skeleton and I completed the task

###### First, I made a home page feauturing an animated wallpaper, title styling, and a navbar which contains links and my own logo.

###### More features in the front page include an animated slideshow decoration in which I will replace with the videos I create in the future

###### Next, the learn tab features videos sorted per units and buttons to easily navigate the videos
###### Currently, the quiz section isn't started yet and I will only work on it after creating the videos
![image](https://github.com/LeeT27/Education-Project/assets/138246438/f9db7599-099c-40eb-bcef-421967c2d103)
###### Lastly, the about me page was made and styled but hasn't yet been filled professionally and I intend to do so soon
## 10/23-10/27: Video Creation 1
###### I began to plan out the geometry curriculem by making chapters based on the khan academy curriculem. I created the official youtube channel for the account and plan to start recording videos very soon
## 10/30-11/3: MVP and video creation
###### Currently still working and planning the curriculem and video format for the learning section of the website. Here is a document to the Minimal Viable Product: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1opyDk2n3kCEueP4NQJc3qiZJ6Bb1WwNvVBes5YPt0/edit?usp=sharing
## 11/6-11/10: New direction
###### After talking with Mr. Lueken, I decided to go on a very different approach for this project. Instead of focusing on making videos for the project, I intend to instead not make my own videos but to link kahn academy's videos and have a much bigger focus on the AI aspect of the project. I also intend to spend much more time compared to the past 2 weeks because I am currently a little behind.
### 11/12 update:
###### Over the week, I have implemented the use of flexbox in order to embed KahnAcademy's videos effectively. I will be done transfering and embedding all videos by next week so that I can focus on the AI component of this project.
## 11/13-11/17: Side NavBar
###### Goal for this week is to implement a side bar for the learn section that can navigate videos by unit and lesson. I am doing this because embedding 50 videos on one page is basically impossible to load

### 11/15 update
###### Added basic vertical navbar that can store many items and if it overflows, it will add a scroll. ![image](https://github.com/LeeT27/Education-Project/assets/138246438/76c91ee5-16de-4f70-bbb7-e5817bcf8f86)
### 11/19 update: 
###### After hours of work at school and trying to find out how to make a submenu from the side nav bar, I finally did it.

### 11/26 update: I DID IT!!!
###### After multiple hours of attempting to make a working system where the src of the video changes based on the submenu of the html, I finally was able to do it with tons of trial and error.
## 11/27-12/1: Plans for the Rest of the Semester
### 11/29 update: Huge progress
###### I finally pasted all of the links for all of the units into my submenu navbar so that each option changes the innerHTML of the title and src of the video, here is a screenshot: ![Screenshot (1)](https://github.com/LeeT27/Education-Project/assets/138246438/947b9737-555d-47d0-ae0f-eec318ad5c96). Here is a document for my future plans until the end of the semester: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FXSdkNhEfi8xmUZWV3ISzN9R8UuFq_gbRlrqK0yjcRY/edit?usp=sharing
